Apple Frameworks is an informational app designed to provide software developers building applications on Apple platforms with the discovery of Apple's range of SDKs and hopefully, inspire developers with new project ideas for their next app.

At its core, the app is mostly informational. Each framework comes with a details page that contains a brief overview of its description, along with a button that users can tap on that will direct them to the framework's homepage on Apple's official website to learn more about the framework in-depth.

For user features, the app contains a dual layout option; **Grid** & **List** - users can switch in-between these two layouts in-app.

#### - Key features & technologies

* MVVM Architecture
* iOS 15+ button system w/ SF Symbols
* Dual layout options with TabView - *users can switch freely between a Grid or List layout*

## Trying it yourself

Apple Frameworks is written using Xcode 13.2 and Swift 5.5 on the SwiftUI framework. To try it out, you can clone this project and build it immediately by opening `AppleFrameworks.xcodeproj`.

As far as I know the app feature is complete, but there are always the likelihood of errors popping up once in a while due to a number of reasons; code deprecation, breaking changes to new SwiftUI version releases, etc. 

If you hit any problems, either building or running the app, please let me know.

## Important notes on usage

Keep in mind that the Apple Frameworks app is a project designed and built for my own personal education purposes and serves as a reference point for my future projects. This app project was to gain practical experience in building an app on the iOS platform with Swift & SwiftUI. The state of this app was never meant to be production-ready, published onto the App Store, or to be monetized in any way, shape, or form.

If you wish to do any of the above, you will have to make some changes to the app before submitting to the App Store for approval. Please keep in mind of any potential violation of third-party license, such as, but not limited to, the usage of SF Symbols in the app icon.
